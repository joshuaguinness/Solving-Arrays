# Solving-Arrays

Given the linear algebra equation Ax = b, and given matrices A and b (which are one dimensional matricies), compute the solution matrix x (also one dimensional). 

The code also times how long it takes to compute the solution. 

It is able to compute the solution for an 8000 x 8000 matrix in 5 minutes with optimization flags.

TO RUN:

Download all the files onto your computer. Type "make." Then run linsolve. It will compute the solution for and time the execution for a 1000 x 1000, 2000 x 2000, 4000 x 4000, and 8000 x 8000 matrix.
